Example: Homeric Accent Notation

- The use of linguistic tonality in pre-Archaic Greek may have resulted directly in melodic pattern formation in sung Homeric epic.

- This linguistic tonality appears to have been replaced by a stress-based system in the Classical period, captured in a complex (and somewhat artificial) grammatical system.

- ἀοιδοί vs. ῥαψῳδoί

- The use of tonality in sung Homer may have outlived the use of tonality in spoken Greek.

- The textual tradition may have preserved some aspects of an accent system more directly reflective of sung Epic than of the more grammatical conception which would evolve.

- This would further evolve into a modern standardized conception of how Ancient Greek accentuation should be written.

- Bankes Papyrus
		- c. 150 AD, found (and very probably written) in Egypt (having long since been the center for Homeric scholarship)
		- Originally contained all of Book 24 of the Iliad (804 lines); now missing lines 24.1-24.126
		- Is incredibly well-preserved for its age; vitally important in Homeric papyri.
		- Uses a very different accent system; it has been theorized that it is more directly reflective of line-extent melody.

- Venetus A
		- c. 10th century, kept in the Library of St. Mark in Venice since the 15th century but most probably written in Byzantium
		- Originally contained all of the Iliad, as well as many footnotes (scholia) and several supplementary texts such as a summary of the Epic cycle and several biographies of Homer; the vast majority of these have survived.
		- It has been theorized that, despite adhering to an evolved grammatical conception of accent rules, the Venetus A contains traces of the previous melody-based accent system.
		- This is important because, if true, it would expose us to a far greater corpus of melodic accentuation than the relatively small corpus of the Bankes can provide.

We have set out to test the claim of surviving melodic material in the Venetus A.

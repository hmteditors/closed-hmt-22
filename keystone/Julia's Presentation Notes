Using Scala:
	Why:
		- a more logical, sophisticated language to work with large amounts of data
	How:
		- load our text
		- using computePitch (function created for this purpose), we can separate out the accents from their words
			*picture*
		- can filter out results based on specific accents (filtering out graves) or distinct patterns
		- does not change original, allowing us to go back and find the line and the urn for any interesting accent patterns (indexOf and corpus.nodes)
			*picture*
		- can also print the line broken up into syllables with the accents via printPitch
			- involves declaring a CTS URN
			*picture*
future:
- plan to compare side by side the differences between Ven A and OCT, as well as Bankes using same methods

Using Scala:
	Why:
		- a more logical, sophisticated language 
		to work with large amounts of data 
			- important because the OCT of the Iliad is over 15,000 lines long)
	How:
		- load our text, using a basic .fromFile function, adapted for our libraries
		- using computePitch, we can separate out the accents from their words, 
		allowing us to run functions on just the accent patterns
			*picture*
		- As you can see here, loaded corpus of text containing urns and the text of each line
		- transformed those into accent patterns
		
		- can filter out results based on specific accents, for example, you can look at lines
		that only have a acute accent or other distinct patterns
		- does not change original, allowing us to go back and find the line and the urn for any  
		accent patterns that we want to investigate further  (indexOf and corpus.nodes)

		- can also print the line broken up into syllables with the accents via printPitch
			- involves declaring a CTS URN

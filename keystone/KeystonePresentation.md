# The Edition

## Overview
- Digital, diplomatic edition of the Venetus A
- Hosted on a github repository
- 150+ Contributors
	
## Paleography and Line Indexing: 
- Take a select number of observations from text and scholia
	- Assigned uniform resource names, which index the edition to the image of the edited text
	- Verifiable
	
## Editing:
- XML Editor, limited set of TEI markup	
- Manual transcription directly from the image of the manuscript to the edition	
- Tag place names, abbreviations, corrections, quotations, etc.
- Separation of concerns: Analysis and editing

## Automated Machine Validation
- Run every edition against the Morpheus Parser, to confirm that it is composed entirely of valid lexical entities and 	valid Greek 
- Collate a list of Byzantine Orthographic Equivalents
- (Occasionally) add new lexical entities not found in the pages of the Liddell and Scott

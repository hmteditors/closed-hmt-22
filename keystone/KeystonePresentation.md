# The Edition

## Overview
- Digital, diplomatic edition of the Venetus A
- Hosted on a github repository
- 150+ Contributors
	
## Paleography and Line Indexing: 
- Take a select number of observations from text and scholia
	- Assigned uniform resource names, which index the edition to the image of the edited text
	- Verifiable
	
## Editing:
- XML Editor, limited set of TEI markup	
- Manual transcription directly from the image of the manuscript to the edition	
- Tag place names, abbreviations, corrections, quotations, etc.
- Separation of concerns: Analysis and editing

## Automated Machine Validation
- Run every edition against the Morpheus Parser, to confirm that it is composed entirely of valid lexical entities and 	valid Greek 
- Collate a list of Byzantine Orthographic Equivalents
- (Occasionally) add new lexical entities not found in the pages of the Liddell and Scott


# Analysis

## General Procedures

## Example: The Evolution of Homeric Accent Notation
### Overview
- The grammar of pre-Archaic Greek was exploited to shape the sound of Homeric epic
	- Vowel quantity = rhythm
	- Linguistic tonality = pitch
- Linguistic tonality died out from the language and was replaced by a system of grammatical accentuation
- ἀοιδοί vs. ῥαψῳδoί
- Early accent systems would have been more reflective of Homeric melody than the more grammatically-conceived systems into which they evolved.
### Bankes Papyrus
- c. 150 AD, Egypt
- One of the most important Homeric papyri for its intactness and antiquity; contains approx. 600 lines
- Includes an accent system which has been theorized to reflect the entirety of the melody of the line

# The Edition

## Overview
- Digital, diplomatic edition of the Venetus A
- Hosted on a github repository
- Line/Scholia indexing: assign each a URN, or a uniform resource name, and reference it to the appropriate line in the 		manuscript	
	- Makes work verifiable
	- The edition we make is tied directly to the image of the physical artifact â€” linked to the primary source
	
## Paleography and Line Indexing: 
- Take a select number of observations from text and scholia
	- Assigned URNs
	
## Editing:
- XML Editor, limited set of TEI markup	
- Work in teams
- Manual transcription directly from the image of the manuscript to the edition	
- Tag place names, abbreviations, corrections, quotations, etc.
- Separation of concerns: Analysis and editing
	
## Automated Machine Validation
- Run every edition against the Morpheus Parser, to confirm that it is composed entirely of valid lexical entities and 	valid Greek 
- Collate a list of Byzantine Orthographic Equivalents
- (Occasionally) add new lexical entities not found in the pages of the Liddell and Scott

## Background:
- Homer Multitext Project
	- Multi-institutional, dedicated to creating digital, diplomatic editions of the Homer manuscripts (Do we need to say why?)
	- Multi-institutional, multinational (too far?)
- Venetus A
	- 10th Century (Oldest)
	- Byzantine
	- Deluxe Readers Guide
	- Scholia

## Editing

# Overview
- Digital, diplomatic edition of the Venetus A
- Hosted on a github repository
- Line/Scholia indexing: assign each a URN, or a uniform resource name, and reference it to the appropriate line in the 		manuscript	
	- Makes work verifiable
	- The edition we make is tied directly to the image of the physical artifact — linked to the primary source
	
# Paleography: 
	- take roughly 40 letter observations from scholia, and 40 from main text
		
	- Each assigned a unique URN
	
# Editing:
	
	- XML Editor, limited set of TEI markup
		
	- Work in teams
		
	- Manual transcription directly from the image of the manuscript to the edition
		
	- Tag place names, abbreviations, corrections, quotations, etc.
	
	- Separation of conerns: Analysis and editing
	
# Automated Machine Validation
	
	- Run every edition against the Morpheus Parser, to confirm that it is composed entirely of valid lexical entities and 	valid Greek 
			
	- Collate a list of Byzantine Orthographic Equivalents
			
	- (Occasionally) add new lexical entities not found in the pages of the Liddell and Scott

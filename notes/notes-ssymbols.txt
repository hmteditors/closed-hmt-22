THINGS THIS IS NOT
--something to do with the meaning of the word
--connecting sign
--correction (such as adding a sigma, cf. symbols in the replacement folios)

--something thematic

THINGS THIS COULD BE
--abbreviation
--critical sign
--I don't know, something metrical?
--????????????????????
--ALIENS.
--stigma/digamma
--something to do with punctuation
--some sort of comparison - because triple sss always come with double ss/single s
--Byzantine pronunciation guide

--------------------------

Three in a row in line 9.466.  SS-SS-SSS
Three on 36r seem to be connected.  SS-S-SSS
SSes in Archimedes??
Appear mostly in book 2, end in book 11, appear again (once) in book 24
--there's one in book 19 but it's very faded.  Perhaps imagining it.
Why do double SSes show up over later hand interlinear scholia?
--those must be different from the others.  Abbreviation?
--similar to Archimedes.  -εις?

--------------------------

Why do these symbols appear over certain words?
Do these words have anything in common?
What's the difference between the single S, the double S, and the triple S?

SINGLE S

PUNCTUATION.  Scholion 451: Until the famous "water" one must put a comma and the "there" in that place where through the local temporal tree through the "yesterday and the day before" it is surrounded and the ends having set "hecatombs" to put in a comma where it is connected (with the hump?) from "the plane-tree" to "terrible".  And it is able to be joined together in these above "yesterday and the day before" where all things having been joined are from this "for indeed we know this well"

Scholion 660: Toward such great thing where Hyrmine and Myrsinus and Alesium and Olenia within the rocks they collapsed and the Eleioi ruled all.  The dipole is because Zenodotus writes with an i and the word is made incongruous.

3.134: He suffers: On the "they are seated", separation

--------------------------------
DOUBLE SS

PUNCTUATION.  Scholion 454: Having darted beneath the chariot:  For on a different beginning the word is unconnected wherefore even one must  put a punctuation mark at the end on the "indeed light"

Scholion 660: Toward such great thing where Hyrmine and Myrsinus and Alesium and Olenia within the rocks they collapsed and the Eleioi ruled all.  The dipole is because Zenodotus writes with an i and the word is made incongruous.

11.327: It is not necessary that those having perceived the thing being displayed - for how did they revive Hector? - to separate on the "revive", since with ours joining together the hyperbaton considered fleeing Hector

24.148: Thus through the n, "so great"

--------------------------------
TRIPLE SSS

2.617: eergei - to shut in. "And they that dwelt in Buprasium and goodly Elis, all that part thereof that Hyrmine and Myrsinus on the seaboard and the rock of Olen and Alesium enclose between them"

9.466(470?): auto - "For nine nights' space about mine own body did they watch the night through;"
